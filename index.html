<p>If you were not able to tell from the top of the page, my name is Alan Kuzmanovic. I am a Bosnian refugee who has immigrated to the United States during the Yugoslavian war. I am a young student, as well as an intellectual property specialist who is working at eBay. As Bosnian is my first language, I am bilingual. I enjoy many things such as playing video games, listening to music, and eating at fancy restaurants. In my free time I enjoy the simple things in life, such as kicking back and relaxing, meditating, cleaning, or dancing alone. </p>
<p>I am a very outdoorsy person. I love beautiful mountain ranges, barren deserts, and flourishing forests. Whenever I get the chance to hit a trail, or explore the wilderness I take it. I love activities that involve getting my adrenaline pumping. These activities include: Skiing, skateboarding, fire spinning, and rock climbing. If there is danger involved you better count me in!</p>
